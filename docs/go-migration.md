# Go runtime test policy

The published and source server runtime is Go. Stable release `0.2.0` is the
documented breaking-change boundary. The Python package remains only as the
`uvx` installation/launch shim and as an `openai-python` test consumer. There
is no Python HTTP implementation or fallback.

## Test ownership

Go owns the behavior closest to the production runtime:

- unit tests for auth, configuration, stores, redaction, request translation,
  SSE parsing, daemon behavior, and proxy path validation;
- deterministic handler contracts in `internal/app/contract_test.go`, using a
  fake Codex HTTP upstream and real HTTP/SSE requests;
- a thin E2E in `test/e2e`, which builds and starts the real executable,
  discovers its OS-assigned port from the stable listen log, makes requests,
  and verifies preflight and shutdown behavior;
- an opt-in real-backend matrix in `test/live`, authored entirely in Go.

The primary test seam is a fake Codex HTTP service. A narrow internal backend
interface is used only for failures that cannot be represented faithfully over
HTTP. Fake payloads use synthetic IDs and valid future-expiry test JWTs; tests
must never copy production tokens or authentication files.

Python has two deliberate roles:

- the package entry point selects and execs the bundled platform-specific Go
  executable for `uvx` installations;
- `openai-python` remains a consumer-level compatibility gate that starts the
  Go binary and exercises it through the public SDK.

Go wire-level tests are canonical for the server itself. An `openai-go` SDK
dependency is not required: direct `net/http` assertions make JSON, headers,
status codes, pagination, and SSE event sequences explicit, while
`openai-python` checks the client API promised by this project.

## Validation levels

Use the smallest useful level while iterating, then run the full gate before a
behavioral commit:

```console
$ go test ./internal/app
$ go test ./test/e2e -v
$ go test ./...
$ go vet ./...
$ go test -race ./...
$ uv run tox
```

The real suite is opt-in because it uses the machine's Codex login, network,
models, and image quota:

```console
$ RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 go test ./test/live -v -count=1 -timeout=20m
```

It checks semantic outputs and exact marker preservation rather than model
wording. A real backend capability can be unavailable independently of the
proxy: for example, the sibling Audio endpoint may return a Cloudflare browser
challenge. In that case the live test verifies transparent reachability and
the deterministic fake-upstream contract remains responsible for the 2xx
response shape.

CI runs native Go tests and vet plus an installed-wheel spawned-server E2E on
Linux, macOS, and Windows for x86_64 and ARM64. Each E2E launches the packaged
Python entry point, which execs the bundled Go server, and sends requests through
a local fake Codex HTTP backend. It neither reads real Codex credentials nor
contacts the real backend. The race detector runs on Linux; live tests stay
manual.

## Post-removal invariants

The Python HTTP server and its implementation-only tests have been retired.
Keep these conditions true:

1. Every public route and lifecycle operation has a deterministic Go contract.
2. The `openai-python` process contract and both Python-authored live suites
   always start Go; they must not grow a second server implementation.
3. The launcher either execs a bundled platform binary or exits clearly. It
   must never silently fall back to Python.
4. Releases publish only the six supported platform wheels. A generic wheel is
   an intermediate build input and must not be uploaded to PyPI.
5. Linux race detection and native installed-wheel E2E on Linux/macOS/Windows
   x86_64/ARM64 remain green.

## ARM64 sign-off record

On 2026-08-12, a statically linked Linux ARM64 Go binary was copied to a
Raspberry Pi 5 over Tailscale and run from
`/home/hotchpotch/tmp/openai-via-codex-go-e2e.lyPw8VMz`. Using that machine's
existing `~/.codex/auth.json`, the live smoke exercised health, models,
Responses create/retrieve/input-items/input-tokens/previous/stream, and Chat
`n=2`. All checks passed and the server was stopped after the run.
