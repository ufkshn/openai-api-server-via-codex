💰 Your ChatGPT subscription includes Codex, but that backend normally only
talks to Codex clients. This server puts an OpenAI-compatible API in front of
it, so tools that already speak to `api.openai.com` can use it by changing one
environment variable.

Within your Codex usage limits, no real OpenAI Platform API key is required,
and there are no additional per-token charges.

<img width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex/main/docs/assets/quick-start.png" alt="Start the Go server with uvx, then call the OpenAI-compatible Responses API" />

## Quick start

Sign in once if `~/.codex/auth.json` does not exist:

```console
$ codex login
```

Start the server in one terminal. The recommended installation requires only
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```console
$ uvx openai-api-server-via-codex
```

Prefer another installation method? Every option runs the same Go server:

- **[Standalone binary](#install-standalone-binary):** download the archive for Linux, macOS, or Windows
  (x86_64 or ARM64) from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex/releases/latest).
- **[Docker](#install-docker):** pull the public image with
  `docker pull ghcr.io/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex:latest`.
- **[Go](#install-go):** build and install directly from the public module with
  `go install github.com/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex/cmd/openai-api-server-via-codex@latest`.
- **[Source checkout](docs/build-from-source.md#build-for-the-current-machine):** clone the repository and build it locally.

See [Installation options](#installation-options) for complete commands,
checksums, platform details, and Docker volume configuration.

Point an existing OpenAI client at it from another terminal:

```console
$ export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18080/v1
$ # This server requires no key by default, but the OpenAI SDK requires a value.
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy-not-a-real-openai-api-key
```

> [!NOTE]
> `dummy-not-a-real-openai-api-key` is deliberately **not a real OpenAI API
> key**. With the default server settings, any non-empty dummy value works: it
> only satisfies the OpenAI SDK's client-side validation and is not checked by
> this server. Incoming requests require a real local key only if you start the
> server with `--api-key`. Codex authentication always uses
> `~/.codex/auth.json`.

Existing OpenAI SDK code keeps working as written:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    input="Hello",
)
print(response.output_text)
```

Save it as `example.py` and run it without permanently installing the SDK:

```console
$ uv run --with openai python example.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking change in v0.2.0:** the HTTP server is now implemented in Go. The
> former Python/FastAPI server and fallback have been removed; the Python
> package is now only a small `uvx` launcher for the bundled Go executable.

> [!TIP]
> **Why Go?** In the recorded Linux proxy benchmark, idle memory fell from about
> 59 MiB to 8.3 MiB (an **86% reduction**) and peak memory fell from 261–304 MiB
> to 18–20 MiB (a **93–94% reduction**). Startup fell from roughly 330 ms to
> 10 ms. See the [benchmark and methodology](docs/performance.md); real model
> latency is dominated by the upstream Codex service.

<details>
<summary><strong>Use Docker instead</strong></summary>

The public image does not require a registry login:

```console
$ docker pull ghcr.io/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex:latest
$ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:18080:18080 \
    -v ~/.codex:/home/app/.codex \
    ghcr.io/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex:latest
```

The auth directory is mounted read-write so refreshed tokens can be saved. See
the [Docker guide](docs/docker.md) for Windows, permissions, Compose, and login
instructions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>PowerShell environment variables</strong></summary>

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:18080/v1"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "dummy-not-a-real-openai-api-key"
uv run --with openai python example.py
```

</details>

## Why use it?

This server is useful when you want to:

- connect an OpenAI-compatible application to your authorized Codex access;
- reuse code written for `openai-python`, LangChain, LiteLLM, or another client
  that supports a custom base URL;
- run a lightweight local proxy without a Python web-server runtime; or
- expose one consistent local API to tools that cannot call the Codex backend
  directly.

| Capability | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| Subscription-backed access | Use the Codex allowance included in your ChatGPT plan without separate Platform API token charges |
| OpenAI compatibility | Responses, Chat Completions, streaming, tools, structured output, images, and audio |
| Small Go runtime | About 8.3 MiB idle RSS and 10 ms startup in the recorded Linux proxy benchmark |
| Portable distribution | Wheels and archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86_64 and ARM64 |
| Local-first defaults | Loopback binding, auth preflight, redacted logs, and optional incoming API-key protection |
| Multiple installation paths | `uvx`, standalone archives, Docker/GHCR, `go install`, or a local source build |

> [!NOTE]
> Your ChatGPT plan limits still apply. Usage beyond the included Codex
> allowance may require additional ChatGPT credits, which can cost extra. See
> the [official Codex pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing).

> [!WARNING]
> This is an unofficial compatibility server, not the OpenAI Platform API. It
> uses the Codex HTTP backend associated with your ChatGPT login, which may
> change without notice. It does not raise or bypass plan limits. Do not expose
> the server publicly, resell access, or use an account you are not authorized
> to use.

## Installation options

| Method | Requirement | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`uvx openai-api-server-via-codex`](#install-uvx) | `uv` and a Codex login | Most users |
| [GitHub Release archive](#install-standalone-binary) | A Codex login | A standalone executable without Python or `uv` |
| [GHCR image](#install-docker) | Docker and a Codex login | Containers and reproducible deployment |
| [`go install ...@latest`](#install-go) | Go 1.23+ and a Codex login | Go users |
| [Build from a checkout](docs/build-from-source.md#build-for-the-current-machine) | Go 1.23+ and a Codex login | Development and customization |

<a id="install-uvx"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Install with uvx or uv tool</strong></summary>

Published wheels contain the Go executable for:

- Linux x86_64 and ARM64
- macOS Intel and Apple silicon
- Windows x86_64 and ARM64

Run without a permanent installation:

```console
$ uvx openai-api-server-via-codex
```

Or install it on your user tool path:

```console
$ uv tool install openai-api-server-via-codex
$ openai-api-server-via-codex --version
```

There is no Python server fallback and no generic source distribution. Build
the Go executable directly on an unsupported platform.

</details>

<a id="install-standalone-binary"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Download a standalone release archive</strong></summary>

Each GitHub Release includes versioned archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows
on x86_64 and ARM64, together with `checksums.txt`. Unix archives use `.tar.gz`;
Windows archives use `.zip`.

For example, on an Apple silicon Mac:

```console
$ curl -LO https://github.com/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex/releases/download/v0.2.0/openai-api-server-via-codex_0.2.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
$ curl -LO https://github.com/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex/releases/download/v0.2.0/checksums.txt
$ grep 'darwin_arm64.tar.gz' checksums.txt | shasum -a 256 --check
$ tar -xzf openai-api-server-via-codex_0.2.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
$ ./openai-api-server-via-codex --version
```

The stable archive URLs and SHA-256 checksums are suitable for Homebrew
Formulae. Installing a historical version through Homebrew requires a tap to
retain a versioned Formula such as `openai-api-server-via-codex@0.2.0`.

</details>

<a id="install-docker"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Run the published Docker image or build it locally</strong></summary>

Stable Linux x86_64 and ARM64 images are published at
`ghcr.io/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex`. `latest` tracks the newest
stable release. Exact tags such as `v0.2.0` provide reproducible deployments;
prereleases publish only their exact version tag.

The final Alpine image contains the Go server and CA certificates, but no
Python runtime or Go toolchain. On amd64, local measurements show about 7 MB of
compressed registry layers, a 21 MB local image, and roughly 4–7 MiB of idle
memory. Exact values depend on the release, architecture, and container runtime.

```console
$ docker pull ghcr.io/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex:latest
$ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:18080:18080 \
    -v ~/.codex:/home/app/.codex \
    ghcr.io/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex:latest
```

Or build from this checkout:

```console
$ docker compose run --rm --service-ports codex-login  # only if auth.json is missing
$ docker compose up --build -d
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/healthz
```

The container runs as a non-root user. See the
[Docker guide](docs/docker.md) for complete usage and troubleshooting.

</details>

<a id="install-go"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Install with Go or build from a checkout</strong></summary>

Go can download and install the command from its public module path:

```console
$ go install github.com/hotchpotch/openai-api-server-via-codex/cmd/openai-api-server-via-codex@latest
$ "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/openai-api-server-via-codex" --version
```

The executable is installed under `GOBIN`, or under `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
when `GOBIN` is unset.

To build from a checkout:

```console
$ go build -trimpath -o ./bin/openai-api-server-via-codex ./cmd/openai-api-server-via-codex
$ ./bin/openai-api-server-via-codex --version
$ ./bin/openai-api-server-via-codex serve
```

This path does not require Python or `uv`. See
[Building the Go binary from source](docs/build-from-source.md) for version
stamping, installation, Windows commands, static builds, and cross-compilation.

## Authentication and security

There are two separate authentication layers:

| Layer | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server → Codex | Required | Uses the ChatGPT login in `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| Client → local server | Disabled | Optionally protects incoming `/v1/...` requests with `--api-key` |

### Codex authentication

`serve` and `start` validate the Codex auth file before binding the HTTP port.
Missing, invalid, expired, or unrefreshable credentials fail startup with a
redacted error, a stable reason code, and a suggested action.

The one exception is when an API key is configured, which enables the
[operator console](#operator-console). Failing startup there would make the
console unreachable in exactly the case it exists for — no `auth.json` yet and
no shell to run `codex login` — so the server logs
`codex.auth.preflight_deferred` and starts anyway. `/v1/...` still rejects every
request until the login is established.

The server notices external changes to `auth.json` without a restart. If Codex
returns `401 Unauthorized` before a streaming response begins, the server
clears its credential cache, reloads the file, and retries once. A second `401`
is returned without another retry.

Select another auth file when needed:

```console
$ openai-api-server-via-codex --auth-json /path/to/auth.json
$ OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_AUTH_JSON=/path/to/auth.json openai-api-server-via-codex
```

### Protecting the local API

Configure an incoming API key when other machines or untrusted processes can
reach the server:

```console
$ openai-api-server-via-codex \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --api-key local-secret
```

Clients must then send `Authorization: Bearer local-secret`. `/healthz` remains
unauthenticated.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not bind to `0.0.0.0` without an incoming API key unless the surrounding
> network provides equivalent access control. The default `127.0.0.1` binding
> is the safest choice for local use.

Incoming API keys, cookies, and `Authorization` headers are never forwarded to
Codex. Normal logs include authentication failure reason codes and upstream
`401` retry decisions, but never raw credentials, tokens, or upstream response
bodies. `--verbose` adds deeper redacted diagnostics.

## Operator console

A small web console at `/ui` for signing the server in to a ChatGPT account
without shell access — the case that matters when it runs as an unattended
container on a shared host.

It offers two paths:

- **Device code** — starts `codex login --device-auth`, shows the one-time code
  and the verification link, and waits while you approve it on any device with a
  browser. Needs the Codex CLI in the image (the `runtime-ui` target below).
- **Paste an `auth.json`** — the fallback when device-code auth is disabled for
  a workspace. Run `codex login` elsewhere and paste the result. The content is
  validated before it replaces anything, so a bad paste cannot destroy a working
  login.

It also reports whether the credentials actually work (not merely that a file
exists), the account, and the token expiry, and can sign out.

### Access control

The console is gated by `OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_API_KEY`, exchanged for an HttpOnly,
`SameSite=Strict` session cookie — a browser cannot attach a bearer header to a
navigation. **When no API key is set the console refuses to serve** rather than
defaulting open, because signing in through it hands over the ChatGPT account.

Treat the console as privileged: reach it over a private interface or a tunnel,
never the public internet.

### Running it

```console
$ export OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.console.yml up -d --build
```

Then open `http://<host>:18080/ui` and unlock with that key.

The `runtime-ui` image is Debian-based rather than Alpine because the Codex CLI
ships a glibc-linked binary. The default `runtime` image is unchanged: still
Alpine, still without the CLI, so `docker build` with no `--target` produces the
same lean server image as before.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom or reason code | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `auth_file_not_found` | Run `codex login`, or pass the correct path with `--auth-json` |
| `invalid_auth_json` or `unsupported_auth_mode` | Run `codex login` again and confirm the login uses ChatGPT mode |
| `expired_without_refresh_token` | Run `codex login` again to create refreshable credentials |
| `token_refresh_failed` | Check network access and retry `codex login` if the failure persists |
| `auth_file_write_failed` in Docker | Mount `/home/app/.codex` read-write and check host UID/GID permissions |
| Repeated upstream `401` | Check the auth reason logs, refresh the Codex login, and avoid multiple servers sharing rotating credentials |
| Address already in use | Stop the existing server or choose another port with `--port` |
| An official OpenAI SDK requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Some official OpenAI SDK clients, including the Python client, require a non-empty `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Set a harmless placeholder such as `dummy-not-a-real-openai-api-key` to use the library normally with this server. |

> [!TIP]
> Start with `--verbose` when diagnosing configuration, request routing, or
> Codex stream behavior. Sensitive token-like values remain redacted.

## Usage examples

<details>
<summary><strong>Chat Completions</strong></summary>

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
chat = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    reasoning_effort="low",
)
print(chat.choices[0].message.content)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Streaming Responses and Chat Completions</strong></summary>

Responses:

```python
stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    input="Stream a short reply.",
    stream=True,
    reasoning={"effort": "low"},
)

for event in stream:
    if event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
        print(event.delta, end="")
```

Chat Completions:

```python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Stream a short reply."}],
    stream=True,
    reasoning_effort="low",
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Image input, generation, and editing</strong></summary>

Image input:

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "input_text", "text": "Describe this image."},
                {
                    "type": "input_image",
                    "image_url": "data:image/png;base64,...",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
)
```

Image generation:

```python
import base64

image = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-image-2",
    prompt="A cozy pixel art bowl of ramen, no text.",
    size="1024x1024",
    quality="medium",
    output_format="png",
)

with open("ramen.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(base64.b64decode(image.data[0].b64_json))
```

Image editing:

```python
edited = client.images.edit(
    model="gpt-image-2",
    image=open("ramen.png", "rb"),
    prompt="Make the bowl blue and keep everything else unchanged.",
    quality="medium",
    output_format="png",
)

with open("ramen-blue.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(base64.b64decode(edited.data[0].b64_json))
```

Pass a list to `image=` to supply several reference images, and `mask=` to edit
only the masked region. Uploads are inlined as data URLs, so `file_id`
references are not supported.

Streamed generation and editing, with intermediate previews:

```python
stream = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-image-2",
    prompt="A cozy pixel art bowl of ramen, no text.",
    stream=True,
    partial_images=2,
)

for event in stream:
    if event.type == "image_generation.partial_image":
        print("preview", event.partial_image_index)
    elif event.type == "image_generation.completed":
        with open("ramen.png", "wb") as file:
            file.write(base64.b64decode(event.b64_json))
```

Edits emit `image_edit.partial_image` and `image_edit.completed` instead.
`partial_images` accepts `0`-`3` and is only a hint: observed live runs have
returned both fewer and more previews than requested, so treat the count as
unpredictable and rely on the completed event, which is the only guaranteed one.
Streaming requires `n=1`.

Images are always returned as `data[].b64_json`; `response_format="url"` is not
implemented, because Codex returns image bytes rather than a hosted URL. Codex
also decides the final pixel dimensions, so a `size` request is a hint rather
than a guarantee.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Function tool calling</strong></summary>

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.6-luna",
    input="What is the weather in Tokyo?",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the weather for a city.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
                "required": ["city"],
                "additionalProperties": False,
            },
            "strict": True,
        }
    ],
)
```

</details>

## API compatibility

<details>
<summary><strong>Supported behavior</strong></summary>

- sync and async `openai-python` clients
- non-streaming and streaming Responses and Chat Completions
- `previous_response_id` backed by bounded local context
- stored Chat list/retrieve/update/delete/messages APIs
- Responses retrieve streaming, delete, cancel, and input-token count
- function/tool calling and streamed tool arguments
- JSON mode and structured outputs
- URL and data-URL image input
- hosted image generation and editing translated through a Codex Responses tool
- streamed image previews via `partial_images`
- optional incoming API-key authentication
- bounded request concurrency and in-memory stores

At the Codex boundary, requests are normalized to `stream=true`, `store=false`,
low text verbosity by default, Codex-compatible tool defaults, and encrypted
reasoning content. Public storage compatibility is implemented in the server's
bounded in-memory stores.

Model listing is best-effort. A model can sometimes accept direct requests even
when it is absent from the upstream catalog returned by `/v1/models`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Implemented endpoints</strong></summary>

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/healthz` |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses` |
| `GET` | `/v1/responses/{response_id}` |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/responses/{response_id}` |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses/{response_id}/cancel` |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses/input_tokens` |
| `POST` | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| `POST` | `/v1/images/generations` |
| `POST` | `/v1/images/edits` |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| `GET` | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| `GET` | `/v1/chat/completions/{completion_id}` |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions/{completion_id}` |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/chat/completions/{completion_id}` |
| `GET` | `/v1/chat/completions/{completion_id}/messages` |

Unknown `/v1/...` requests use a best-effort fallback proxy. The server
forwards the method, path, query, safe OpenAI-style headers, and body with its
own Codex credentials. Upstream support determines whether an unknown endpoint
returns `2xx`, `400`, `403`, or `404`.

</details>

## Operations and configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration file and important settings</strong></summary>

Generate a configuration file:

```console
$ openai-api-server-via-codex config-generate
$ openai-api-server-via-codex config-generate --stdout
```

The default path is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openai-api-server-via-codex/config.toml`, falling back to
`~/.config/openai-api-server-via-codex/config.toml`.

Settings resolve in this order:

```text
CLI flag -> environment variable -> config file -> default
```

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 18080
default_model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
timeout = 300.0
verbose = false
max_stored_items = 1000
max_concurrent_requests = 10
# api_key = "change-me"

[codex]
auth_json = "~/.codex/auth.json"
backend_base_url = "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex"
client_version = "1.0.0"
originator = "codex_exec"
user_agent = "codex_exec/0.146.0 (Mac OS 15.6.1; arm64) iTerm.app (codex_exec; 0.146.0)"

[compat]
drop_params = ["fast_mode"]

[daemon]
state_dir = "~/.config/openai-api-server-via-codex/run"
stop_timeout = 10.0
```

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `server.host` | `127.0.0.1` | HTTP bind address |
| `server.port` | `18080` | HTTP port |
| `server.default_model` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Model used when a request omits one |
| `server.api_key` | unset | Protect incoming `/v1/...` requests |
| `server.max_stored_items` | `1000` | Bound local stores; `0` disables storage |
| `server.max_concurrent_requests` | `10` | Bound complete requests/streams; `0` disables the cap |
| `server.timeout` | `300.0` | Codex backend timeout in seconds |
| `server.verbose` | `false` | Enable redacted application diagnostics |
| `codex.auth_json` | `~/.codex/auth.json` | Codex OAuth file |
| `codex.originator` | `codex_exec` | `originator` header sent upstream |
| `codex.user_agent` | Codex CLI string | `User-Agent` sent upstream; empty falls back to `openai-api-server-via-codex/<version>` |
| `compat.drop_params` | `["fast_mode"]` | Top-level request fields removed before forwarding |

**On `originator` / `user_agent`:** the Codex backend does not treat every
caller alike — requests identifying as the official `codex_exec` CLI are
accepted where a third-party originator is throttled or refused. These default
to the CLI's own values for that reason, and are configurable so the choice
stays visible. `service_tier` is additionally forwarded as an `X-Service-Tier`
header, because passing it in the request body alone had no effect.

`fast_mode` is dropped by default: it measurably hurt latency against Codex.

Examples:

```console
$ openai-api-server-via-codex --port 19090 --verbose
$ OPENAI_VIA_CODEX_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=20 openai-api-server-via-codex
$ openai-api-server-via-codex --config ./config.toml
```

Use `drop_params` only for parameters known to be rejected by Codex:

```toml
[compat]
drop_params = ["temperature", "top_p"]
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Background daemon commands</strong></summary>

The Go executable implements foreground and daemon lifecycle commands:

```console
$ openai-api-server-via-codex start
$ openai-api-server-via-codex status
$ openai-api-server-via-codex stop
```

PID and log files default to:

```text
~/.config/openai-api-server-via-codex/run/
```

On Linux and macOS, `stop` drains in-flight HTTP requests up to
`--stop-timeout`. Windows terminates the daemon process tree on a best-effort
basis, so an active stream may be interrupted.

Docker should run `serve` in the foreground and let the container runtime manage
restarts; do not use `start` inside a container.

<details>
<summary><strong>Logging behavior</strong></summary>

Normal operation logs one completion line per API request with its method,
redacted path, status, response size, and duration. Routine `/healthz` probes
stay quiet.

Verbose logs additionally include request starts and redacted query strings,
resolved settings, endpoint summaries, and Codex stream/auth activity. Raw
credentials and token-like values are redacted.

## Development

<details>
<summary><strong>Build, test, and release documentation</strong></summary>

The HTTP server, backend integration, auth, configuration, stores, daemon, and
redaction logic are implemented in Go under `cmd/` and `internal/`. Python is
used only for the `uvx` launcher, the official `openai-python` consumer
contract, and release tooling.

Requirements:

- Go 1.23 or newer
- Python 3.10 or newer
- `uv`

Run the complete deterministic validation suite:

```console
$ uv run tox
```

Focused Go validation:

```console
$ go test ./internal/app
$ go test ./test/e2e -v
$ go test ./...
$ go vet ./...
$ go test -race ./...
```

OpenAI SDK consumer compatibility:

```console
$ uv run python -m pytest tests/test_openai_client_contract.py -q
```

Real Codex tests are opt-in because they use the current login, network, model
allowance, and image quota:

```console
$ RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 go test ./test/live -v -count=1 -timeout=20m
$ RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run python -m pytest tests/test_live_integration.py -q -s
$ RUN_CODEX_LIVE_TESTS=1 uv run python -m pytest tests/test_live_codex_http_compatibility.py -q -s
```

Releases are prepared on a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch and reviewed through a PR.
Merging the PR does not publish artifacts; pushing the annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag
on the merged commit starts the release workflow.

Use this project at your own risk. It is not the official OpenAI Platform API
and is not endorsed or supported by OpenAI. It forwards requests to the Codex
HTTP backend used by the Codex CLI and ChatGPT subscription flow instead of
`api.openai.com`; that backend may change without notice.

Use the server only with accounts and subscriptions you are authorized to use.
